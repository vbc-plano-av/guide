## Planning Center Services
To coordinate the worship musicians and A/V team, we use [Services by Planning Center](https://services.planningcenteronline.com). If you don't have an account, ask Greg!

Planning Center gives you a way of seeing what weeks you're on, and once the worship leader decides on it, the arrangements and order of the songs.

Basic instructions are on [the Planning Center page](./planning-center). If you need more information than that, you can see their help docs [right here](https://pcoservices.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).


## Igniter Media
Village has a subscription to [Igniter Media](https://www.ignitermedia.com/) for all our media needs, including:
- motion backgrounds
- text overlays
- short films
- sermon bumpers
- still images

{{< panel status="warning" title="Note on Videos">}}Our projectors really don't display at a resolution to fully take advantage of HD / 4K videos.
In fact, higher-resolution videos can actually cause the audio to stutter when played through ProPresenter! Unless the media will be played through some other program, you're better off downloading a 720p video.{{< /panel >}}

## CCLI Song Select

Song information is pulled from CCLI's [SongSelect](https://songselect.ccli.com/). You mostly won't need this, but if you are adding a new song, you can connect directly to Song Select from ProPresenter to easily import lyrics. Ask Ben for login details.

If you encounter a song without metadata (Artist, Publisher, etc), use CCLI to look this up.
