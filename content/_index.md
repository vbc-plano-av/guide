 Welcome to the VBC Plano Campus A/V Guide!

## What's this about?

There are a *lot* of moving parts when it comes to running the tech side of our services at Village. It's easy to lost track of things!

The goal of this site is the openly document the different aspects of the A/V team so that all members of the team can easily learn and understand how things work. It will make training easier, and will help our production to be consistent, and of course, high quality.
