Running media for services (and other events) mostly means controlling the projectors. Sermon notes, worship lyrics, videos.

Our primary tool[^1] for this is [ProPresenter](./propresenter). You can find *their* documentation [over here](https://support.renewedvision.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002412274-ProPresenter-7).

We don't want to recreate all their help docs, but we will document the specific ways that *we* use it to run services at the Plano Campus.
