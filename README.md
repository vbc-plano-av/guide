# The Plano Campus AV Guide
A guide to AV at Village Bible Church - Plano Campus

# Getting Started
This repository is meant to be run as a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site via [SiteJS](https://sitejs.org/) for ease of use and simplicity.

**SiteJS must already be installed prior to using this!**

To start running the AV Guide, simply clone this repo into a folder `.hugo`. When SiteJS runs, it will recognize this as a Hugo site and do the rest for you.

# Editing Site Contents
The entire site is written in **Markdown**. Folders within the `.hugo` directory will be converted to a page structure automatically.
